# A Basic Agent using LangChain Framework

This example shows a basic agent (in-context learning) using LangChain framework. LangChain is one of the matured framework with many easy use libraries and tools. 
However, it often breaks backward compatibility and further tracing is not free.

In this series, we are only showing two examples of using LangChain and focus on using Google ADK for bravity.

## Running the agent
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python agent.py
```

## Output
You should get outputs similar to those shown in output_paypal_com.json and output_paypal_login.json.
