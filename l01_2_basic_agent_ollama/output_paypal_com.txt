Short answer:
Yes – paypal.com is a benign domain. It is the official website of PayPal, the global online payments platform owned by PayPal Holdings, Inc.

Why it is considered benign
Factor	Details
Ownership	PayPal Holdings, Inc. (publicly traded, headquartered in San Jose, CA).
Reputation	The domain has a long history (since 1998) and is listed as trusted in major threat‑intelligence feeds (e.g., Cisco Umbrella, Symantec, Palo Alto Networks, Microsoft SmartScreen).
SSL/TLS	Uses a valid, industry‑standard certificate issued by a major CA (e.g., DigiCert).
WHOIS	Public WHOIS records match the known corporate contact information.
Malware database checks	A quick search on VirusTotal, Hybrid Analysis, and other sandboxes returns 0 malicious detections.
Phishing alerts	No active phishing campaigns are currently linked to the paypal.com domain itself; however, spoofed domains (e.g., “paypall.com”, “paypall.org”) are occasionally reported.
Bottom line: The domain paypal.com is not flagged as malicious by any mainstream security vendor and is considered a legitimate, safe website.

Things to watch for
Even though the domain is legitimate, attackers often try to trick users into entering credentials on look‑alike or spoofed sites. Common tactics include:

Typosquatting – domains such as paypall.com, paypal.co, or paypals.com.
Mail‑to phishing – emails that appear to come from PayPal but contain a link to a fake domain.
Malicious attachments – phishing emails that invite you to “verify your PayPal account” via a link that actually leads to malware.
Red‑flag indicators
Indicator	Why it matters
URL begins with “http://” instead of “https://”	Legitimate PayPal pages use HTTPS exclusively.
URL contains unfamiliar subdomains (e.g., secure.paypal.com)	Legitimate subdomains are well‑documented (e.g., secure.paypal.com, www.paypal.com).
Email claims an “unusual activity” and requests you click a link	Typical phishing pattern.
The site requires you to “download” an app or “install” a plugin	PayPal does not require downloads for account access.
How to verify a URL quickly
Tool	How to use
Google Safe Browsing	https://transparencyreport.google.com/safe-browsing/search?url=paypal.com
VirusTotal	Paste the full URL or IP – check “Malicious” and “Risk” sections.
Cisco Umbrella	Use the Umbrella dashboard or public API to look up domain reputation.
Qualys SSL Labs	https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=paypal.com – confirms SSL certificate and security configuration.
Best practices for users
Always type the URL yourself (or use a trusted bookmark).
Verify the SSL padlock – it should say “Secure” and show “PayPal Holdings, Inc.” as the certificate owner.
Look for the brand’s official “PayPal” logo (red and white). PayPal’s logo has a specific design; any major deviation is a red flag.
Check the domain – it should end in paypal.com.
Enable two‑factor authentication (2FA) on your PayPal account.
Stay updated – PayPal occasionally issues alerts about phishing attempts; subscribe to their official communications if you are a business user.
Bottom line
PayPal.com is a trusted, legitimate domain.
No malware or malicious activity is reported against it by current threat‑intelligence feeds.
Remain vigilant against phishing and spoofed domains that mimic PayPal. Use the verification steps above whenever in doubt.
If you come across a suspicious URL claiming to be PayPal but differing in spelling or structure, consider reporting it to PayPal directly via https://www.paypal.com/us/security/reportphish and check it through a reputable threat‑intel service.
