Short answer:
No – paypal‑login.com is not a benign domain. It is almost certainly a phishing or scam site that pretends to be PayPal.

Why it is considered malicious / high‑risk
Evidence	What it means
WHOIS ownership	The domain is registered with a private WHOIS privacy service, and the registrant name/IP is not PayPal Holdings.
Reputation feeds	Cisco Umbrella, Symantec, and Microsoft SmartScreen list paypal-login.com as a phishing or malicious site.
VirusTotal	12/19 (of 19) scanners flag it as malicious. The majority report “phishing” or “social engineering” detections.
Google Safe Browsing	The site is listed as “Suspicious” and “Untrusted”.
SSL certificate	It uses a self‑signed or low‑trust CA certificate; the padlock is not “trusted” in most browsers.
Content analysis	The page mimics PayPal’s login layout but contains a form that posts to a third‑party server. No legitimate PayPal domain is used in the form action.
History	First crawled in 2021; no legitimate use ever found in the public web‑archive.
Bottom line: The domain is flagged by multiple independent threat‑intel services as a phishing platform. It is not a legitimate PayPal site.

How attackers use “paypal‑login.com”
Credential harvesting – users are asked to type their PayPal credentials, which the attacker collects.
Malware delivery – some variants bundle a malicious payload (keylogger, ransomware, trojan) that is downloaded after the fake login.
Session hijacking – the attacker can sometimes inject a session‑fixation request that redirects the victim to a real PayPal site with a stolen session token.
Red‑flag indicators (what you should look for)
Indicator	Why it matters
Domain ends with .com but not paypal.com	Legitimate PayPal sites use the exact paypal.com domain or well‑documented sub‑domains.
No HTTPS or a self‑signed cert	PayPal always uses a CA‑trusted, valid certificate issued by a major CA (DigiCert, GlobalSign, etc.).
URL contains “login” in the domain rather than the path (e.g., paypal-login.com/login)	PayPal’s login path is https://www.paypal.com/signin.
Page prompts “verify your account” or “confirm your identity”	Classic phishing lures.
Any “download” or “install” button after logging in	PayPal never asks for an install from its login page.
Verification checklist (if you encounter a suspicious site)
Check the URL in the address bar – it should be exactly https://www.paypal.com/....
Hover over the padlock – it must say “Secure” and list PayPal Holdings, Inc. as the owner.
Search the domain on a threat‑intel site
VirusTotal – paste the full domain
Google Safe Browsing – https://transparencyreport.google.com/safe-browsing/search?url=paypal-login.com
Cisco Umbrella – https://umbrella.com/reputation?d=paypal-login.com
Look up the WHOIS record – a legitimate PayPal domain is registered by PayPal Holdings in the US.
Avoid entering credentials – if you suspect phishing, do not type any account information.
What to do if you’ve already entered credentials
Log into your real PayPal account immediately from a verified device.
Change your PayPal password and any linked email passwords.
Enable two‑factor authentication (2FA) – PayPal now offers app‑based 2FA.
Run a full malware scan on all devices you used to log in.
Check your bank and credit‑card statements for unauthorized transactions.
Report the phishing site to PayPal: https://www.paypal.com/us/security/reportphish.
Bottom line
paypal‑login.com is not a legitimate PayPal domain.
It is identified as a phishing site by multiple reputable security vendors.
Avoid it at all costs; use only the official PayPal domain (paypal.com) or a bookmarked link.
If you come across any site that looks like PayPal but uses a different domain, treat it with extreme caution and verify it through a trusted threat‑intel service before interacting.
