# Basic Standalone Agent

In the previous lessons, we executed the agent via adk web (Agent Web UI). What if you want to run the agent programatically?

This lesson does exactly that. It shows how to run an agent without using the web UI. This pattern is useful if you are not building a chatbot but use it to solve a specific
task.

## Running the agent
```
python agent.py
```
