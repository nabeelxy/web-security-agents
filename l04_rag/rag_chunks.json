The threat actor is evolving their tactics by expanding their reach globally, improving the social engineering tactics used in smishing for delivery.\\n\\nThe threat actor is also expanding the range of services they impersonate to include many international services in critical sectors, such as:\\n\\nBanking\\nCryptocurrency platforms\\nE-commerce platforms\\nHealthcare\\nLaw enforcement\\nSocial media\\nThe campaign is highly decentralized, lacking a single point of control, and uses a large number of domains and a diverse set of hosting infrastructure.
